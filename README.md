# Machine-Learning
1.  Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific
hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data
from a .CSV file. (use enjoysport.csv)
2. Implement email spam classification using naive Bayes algorithm.
3. Implement Linear regression to predict house prices using Least squared method. (use  homeprice_uni.csv)
3. Implement Linear regression to predict house prices using gradient descent algorithm. (use  homeprice_uni.csv)
4. Implement Linear regression to predict house prices based on multiple variables. (use  homeprice_multivariate. csv)
5. Implement  Linear regression to predict house prices based on multiple variables using regularization techniques and explain how regularisation overcome overfitting problem. (use inbuilt dataset boston-  from sklearn.datasets import load_boston)
